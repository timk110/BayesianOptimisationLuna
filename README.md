In Development: Note that this code is still a work in progress. It is not designed for ease of use by people other than myself. However it may be useful for other people, serving as a starting point for further iteration

Description: This code base is designed to apply Bayesian optimisation (BO) to the task of achieving the resonant dispersive wave pulse with the highest peak power, and pulse durations under 5 fs. It uses the Luna.jl code

Installation: TBA

Quickstart : TBA 
Complications: 


Dependencies: This code uses the open source library for Bayesian Optimisation in python (https://github.com/bayesian-optimization/BayesianOptimization)
and Luna.jl (written in Julia) for simulating nonlinear dynamics in gas filled hollow capillary fibres.
